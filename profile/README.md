**An organization that makes software benefiting the MC ecosystem.**

We used to have a Minecraft network, but it's closed as of 14th July 2024. It was fun while it lasted.

This GitHub organization hosts our open-source and private projects and incorporates tech nerds who also play Minecraft.

Thanks for passing by!
